##App Description

Hood Scout is a customizable online heatmap. The purpose of the heatmap is to visualize the intersection and severity of favorable and unfavorable neighborhood characteristics, like the presence of crime and parks.

Not all prospective home buyers have the same idea of what is a favorable characteristic, so our application features options for the inclusion or exclusion of variables and also the adjustment of their priority relative to one another.

Without a real estate agent (whom some of our users may be unable to afford), it can be hard to find the starting point for any housing search to decide which neighborhood will work best for the needs of an individual or a business.

We decided to engineer a software solution to empower society to make smarter choices in their home buying decisions.

Hood Scout is a web app solution that points users toward neighborhoods in the Greater Seattle area that fit their criteria. Hood Scout is a heat map with the locations of Seattle’s schools, parks, and other neighborhood amenities (which create positive heat) and the locations of crimes (which create negative chill), each controlled by its own priority bar, which enables users to customize their family’s needs for safety, recreation, and education.

Hood Scout empowers our global users to quickly find neighborhoods that cater to their needs and wants.
