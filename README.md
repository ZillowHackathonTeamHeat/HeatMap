## Description of the application

HoodScout is a customizable heatmap web application based on the Google Maps JavaScript API v3. The purpose of the heatmap is to visualize the intersection and severity of favorable and unfavorable neighborhood characteristics, like the presence of crime (unfavorable) and parks (favorable). Of course not all prospective home buyers have the same conception of what constitutes a favorable characteristic, which is why our application allows for the inclusion and exclusion of variables and also the adjustment of their priority relative to one another.

Without a real estate agent (whom some of our users may be unable to to afford), it can be hard to find the starting point for any housing search: deciding which neighborhoods will work best for an individual’s needs - and we wanted to change that. We are Team Heat, and this weekend we created HoodScout. 
    
(We used Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Google Maps Javascript API v3)

HoodScout is a web application that points users towards neighborhoods in the Greater Seattle Area that would fit their criteria. HoodScout is a Heat Map with the locations of Seattle’s schools, parks, and other neighborhood amenities (which create positive ‘heat’) and the locations of crimes, each controlled by their own priority bar, which enables our users to customize their family’s needs for safety, recreation, and education, and quickly find neighborhoods that cater to them.
